Description: Estimation, prediction, and simulation of nonstationary Gaussian process with modular covariate-based covariance functions. 
  Sources of nonstationarity, such as spatial mean, variance, geometric anisotropy, smoothness, and nugget, can be considered based on spatial characteristics. 
  An induced compact-supported nonstationary covariance function is provided, enabling fast and memory-efficient computations when handling densely sampled domains.
